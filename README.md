Hello I Am Vihaan A 13 Year Old Student From Mumbai in India. I love to make stuff which are electrical or technological. I recently went for National Robotics League on 6,7Th of December to Play against other teams and We got 2nd Place in Indias Biggest Robotics Competition. I want to make this robo hand for people who are disabled who cannot walk make it easier for the to control thing such as they are sitting on one place and want to change the tv remote channel they can use the hand and do it using the glove provided
I am looking for some components that are out of my budget so i need a grant for it so i can make it come true. 
I want to make the first prototype look good and be good and helpful and showcase it in my school since i dont have a 3d printer I would like to order it or find a 3d printer or buy a new one A new one costs nearly 15k Rupees which converts to approx 170$ And it is the cheapest Printer so i was hoping to get some grant to buy a new printer or order the parts i needed from a nearby centre or online.
  Arduino UNO
Flex Sensor 2.2 inch
Servo Motor
Resistor 10k ohm
Transparent String / Fishing String
2/3mm Elastic Rope
Adhesive Glue
Gloves
Breadboard
Jumper Wires

This will help me alot in my future Jobs or Opportunities and gain some confidence and knowledge
