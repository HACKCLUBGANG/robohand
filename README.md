RoboHand - A Assistive robotic hand

The robohand that I am making uses flex sensors servo motors 3d parts arduino uno r3 module.
It helps people with disabilities do work without needing help or any extra work it can be used wearing a glove with flex sensors

How It Works 
1. The flex sensor on the glove measures how much your fingers bend.
2. 2. The Arduino reads the sensor and tells the servo motors how much to move.
3. Each servo moves a string that bends a finger on the 3D printed hand.
4. The robotic hand moves just like your fingers.
5. When finger retracted the elastic band in the fingers help finger to back into its original postion

How I Organized My Project
My project files are organized like this:

/pcb        - Circuit schematic, PCB layout, renders  
/cad        - 3D models and assembly images  
/firmware   - Arduino code  
/assets     - Extra pictures like cart screenshots  
/bom        - Bill of Materials CSV
